        <h3>Growit! Mobile App</h3>
            GrowIt! Is the fastest growing digital community for people who like plants.
            The platform is entirely mobile and available for Free on the App Store and Google Play.
            Growit! makes it easy for people to find great plants that they might be interested in and learn how to grow them.
            They can also find others in their area who have the same type of plant interests.
            The app uses your gps to show you plants and people around you so that the content is always relevant.

        <h3>The Project Summary</h3>
            As the project manager, I led a group of 3 developers in the redesign of the Growit app to include
            a more interconnected way for the users to communicate. We developed new features like a chat page where
            the users could up-vote/down-vote answers to questions. We encouraged the users to interact by initiating
            a gaming/reward aspect on their personal icon. This gives both recognition and validity to the user and
            is a way for the user to establish themselves in the Growit community.
